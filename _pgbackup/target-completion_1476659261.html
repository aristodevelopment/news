                            <p class="body-detail">Dozens of construction workers are working to keep the $70 million ONE Cable Beach luxury condominium project on schedule for a March 2017 completion date. Developer is Aristo, a success story in exclusive multi-family developments in what is widely considered a challenging real estate environment. </p>
                            <p class="body">ONE  Cable  Beach,  the  $70  million  ultra-luxury  condominium  project  on  West  Bay  Street,  is  on target   for   its   scheduled   March   2017   completion   with   every   significant   infrastructure   and   site preparation deadline met to date, the developer said today.</p>
                            <p class="body">"We have a great team and have been fortunate that we have been able to meet every deadline we  set  even  with  all  the  rain  we  have  been  facing,  said  Jason  Kinsale,  CEO  and  President  of  Aristo Development,  the  group  behind  the  seven-storey,  69-unit  oceanfront  residential  complex  just  west  of Melia Nassau Beach Resort.</p>
                            <p class="body">"All  the  footings  for  the  foundation  have  been  poured.  More  than  200  pilings  have  been completed and we are going vertical with the building this week right on schedule,͟ Kinsale said. At the peak  of  construction  Kinsale  expects  ONE  Cable  Beach  to  generate  about  150 construction  jobs.  Some 35-40  persons  were  on  site  when  Mosko  United  Construction/Bahamas  Marine  was  drilling  and installing underground pilings. Greyco, also a Bahamian company, is doing concrete work.</p>
                            <p class="body">While  construction  progresses  on  schedule,  sales  of  the  residences  starting at  well  under  $1 million continue to be brisk.</p>
                            <p class="body">"We  are  close  to  50%  sold  before  the  building  comes  out  of  the  ground which  is  an  excellent place  to  be,͟  said  Matthew  Marco,  Aristo  Sales  &  Marketing  Director. The  positive  response  to  the offering, I believe, is a reflection of two factors – one is the reputation of Aristo. Every project that Jason Kinsale and his team have taken on they have delivered on, Hampton Ridge, Balmoral, all sold out with buyers actually requesting more."</p>
                            <p class="body">The second contributor, Marco believes, is a continually growing appreciation of The Bahamas.</p>
                            <p class="body">"I've been traveling quite a lot – New York, Washington, Miami – and every property show I go to  when  I  say  Bahamas  I  hear  the  same  thing, 'You  mean  there  is  still  oceanfront  available  in Nassau?' The  interest  in  oceanfront  is  confirmation  that  our  two-year  search  and  negotiation  for  the  perfect property  was  the  right  strategy.  This  truly  is  the  very  last  spot  of  oceanfront  in  the  area  and  the  only future  development  that  can  take  place  along  the  northern  coast  will  involve  razing  an  existing structure. Whether you call it the Bahamian Riviera or Cable Beach, the reality is that it is a spectacular piece  of  shoreline  that  is  hard  to  match  anywhere  in  the  world –  close  to  conveniences  and  far  from boring."</p>
                            <p class="body">But ONE is not the only place Aristo applied the right product-right property, right price strategy and  enjoyed  success.  Last  month,  it  launchedTHIRTY  |  SIX, the  first  new  condo  complex  on  Paradise Island in years. More than one-third of the 38 residences in the three-storey building on Bay View Drive were reserved prior to the launch and there were additional sales at the launch event at Graycliff.</p>
                            <p class="body">Kinsale also believes that Aristo's commitment to distinctive architecture is making a difference. We want our designs to make a statement and take advantage of the setting and surrounding without overpowering  it, he  said.  At  ONE  Cable  Beach,  that  translates  into  a  striking  structure  with  curving balconies  that  almost  appear  to  float.  Kinsale  has  called  it organic  and  free-flowing,  giving  you  an almost palpable sense of freedom, inspiration and pleasure."</p>
                            <p class="body">Residences at ONE Cable Beach range from $575,000  for a one-bedroom  to $3,995,000 for the 3,900  square  foot,  3-bedroom  penthouse  facing  the  sea. ONE  Cable  Beach  features  ocean  and  garden views, swimming pool, fitness centre, security, storm-rated windows and oversized doors, high ceilings, and quality construction with the finest in finishing details.</p>
