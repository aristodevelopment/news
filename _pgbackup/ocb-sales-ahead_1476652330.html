                            <p class="body">Sales   of   luxury   beachfront   condos   in   the   iconic   $45   million   ONE   Cable   Beach development are exceeding expectation with 40% of the residences sold prior to pouring of the foundation, the projects developer said today.</p>
                            <p class="body">The  response  to  the  offering  of  ONE  Cable  Beach  has  exceeded  our  projection,͟  said Jason  Kinsale,  president  and  CEO  of  Aristo  Development,  which  is  funding  and  building  the  7-storey,  69-unit  ultra-luxurious  condominium  complex  on Cable  Beach. I  have  been  told –  and we  are  trying  to  confirm –  that  the  success  we  have  enjoyed  so  far  is  unprecedented  for  this stage  of  a  development  and  may  be  setting  a  record,  with  40%  of  a  residential  project  sold before the foundation is poured.<br><br>The  project,  which  broke  ground  quietly  without  fanfare  or  a  formal  ceremony,  has been humming along with hundreds of thousands of dollars of heavy equipment preparing the site  and  working  on  infrastructure.  A  sales  office  is  open  daily  on  the  property  west  of  Melia Nassau Beach Resort and less than a half mile east of Sandals Royal Bahamian on Cable Beach.<br>
    The  success  to  date,  Kinsale  believes,  is  due  largely  to  location –  the  last  available acreage in the sought-after Cable Beach area directly on the waterfront.<br><br>I  drove  around  for  one  year  searching  for  a  suitable  piece  of property,  he  admitted. When  the  purchase  was  complete,  an  abandoned  house  had  to  be  demolished  and  hauled away. But the linear footage and the high elevation made the site ideal for construction. When you  come  out  here  and  see  the  sparkling  turquoise  waters,  it takes  your  breath  away,  even mine,  and  I  am  accustomed  to  developing  properties.  I  am  supposed  to  think  of  it  as  business but I can͛t help but feel a little emotional when I walk this property so I understand how people, especially  those  coming  from  the  northern  U.S.,  Canada  and  Europe, would  be  struck  by  its beauty and want to buy.<br><br>We  do  hope  that  as  the  building  rises  from  the  ground  we  will  see  more  Bahamian sales.  We  have  had  a  lot  of  interest  from  Bahamians  and  we  expect  to turn  some  of  that interest  into  concrete  sales  to  people  who  either  buying  for themselves  as  a  residence  or recognize  the  value  for  investment  purposes.  Every  sale  we  make  we  hear  words  like, 'I  know this is a smart investment.'<br><br>If location is part of the attraction, there is no question that the impressive design adds appeal. The  architecture  features  a  wave-like  exterior  in  sharp  white  with  extensive  free-form balconies.  The single building consists of nearly 70 residences ranging in price from $555,000 for a one-bedroom to $3 million  for  the  3,900  square  foot,  3-bedroom  penthouse  facing  the  sea.  Residences  have  ocean  or garden views and the property includes a swimming pool, fitness centre, security, storm-rated windows and oversized doors, high ceilings, and quality construction with the finest in finishing details.<br><br>Aristo, which is also developing the popular residential community Balmoral in New Providence, now has nearly $100 million in projects under construction on the island.</p>
