                            <p class="body-detail"><b>Up  on  the  roof</b>—Months  after  all  available  units  at  Balmoral,  including  this rooftop,  were sold out, Aristo Development announced plans to build nine more residences from $419,000 to $579,000. Three were sold the first day, October 31, at pre-construction prices.</p>
                            <p class="body">At 12 o’clock Saturday afternoon, Sean Curry and Sandi Kinsale put out the Open House sign at Balmoral, a sold-out development of smartly designed townhomes, condos and private homes that was, after much demand, offering nine new residences ranging from $419,000 to $579,000.</p>
                            <p class="body">Within half an hour, three were taken and another was under discussion.</p>
                            <p class="body">"It’s amazing, said Matt Marco, Director of Sales and Marketing for Aristo, the design-build firm that developed Balmoral. We kept being asked for new units but we did not realize  just how great the appetite  was.  Three  of  the  nine  offerings,  including  some  of  the  most expensive,  were  gobbled  up  in minutes."</p>
                            <p class="body">The appeal could be linked to Balmoral’s 100% occupancy rate making the secure community a practical choice for those who buy for investment and rent for revenue while building equity.</p>
                            <p class="body">Saturday’s success was the latest for Aristo Development, the company that has withstood  the elements of an economic tsunami. Aristo’s first project was the modest Hampton Ridge, which sold out almost  immediately.  Next  came  Balmoral,  also  a  sell-out,  then  ONE  Cable  Beach  45%  sold  at  pre-construction  prices  and  most  recently  the  announcement  of  36  Paradise, the  first  new  condominium complex on Paradise Island in a decade. Company president is Jason Kinsale.</p>
                            <p class="body">Every  one  of  our  projects  is  unique  and  appeals  to  a  different  market,  says  Kinsale,  who chooses Balmoral as home for his family. With Balmoral, we were very fortunate to be able  to secure the property which had been one of the country’s great estates. We were committed to maintaining the beautiful trees, mature landscaping and the original estate home that serves as clubhouse. The  slightly hilly  nature  and  winding  roads  and  paths  all  give  it  a  young  and  vibrant  feel  for  young  professionals riding  bikes,  walking  to  the  tennis  court,  or  just  out  enjoying  an  evening.  There’s  privacy  behind  each unit  with  a  minimum  of  25  feet  per  back  yard  no  matter  the  size  of  the  townhome  or  condo  and  an inviting openness in front lending a sense of community.</p>
                            <p class="body">Marco  and  Kinsale  agree  that  design  and  the  right  price  point  added  to  the  quick  response  to the  offerings. At  Balmoral,  the  most  expensive  unit  is  the  three  storey  rooftop,  with  2,000  square  feet under  roof  and  a  1,000  square  foot  patio.  In  addition  to  amenities  and fine  finishes,  the  price  of $579,000 buys a 360-degree panoramic view of New Providence spanning from the blues of the Atlantic Ocean  to  the  calm  of  the  southern  coast.    By  Saturday  afternoon,  two  rooftops  were sold,  only  one remained available.</p>
                            <p class="body">The other seven options are the Supreme and the Bungalow.</p>
                            <p class="body">"With  the  new  Balmoral  options,  we  designed  one  building  of  three,  1,400  square  foot,  two-bedroom  condominiums  which  we  call  the  Supreme,  and  another  building  of  four  1,800  square  feet, three-bedroom homes called Bungalows, said Marco</p>
                            <p class="body">With construction set  to begin by the end of the year, the open house was the only chance for buyers to opt in at pre-construction prices of $419,000 for the Supreme. By 12:30 pm, a half hour after the open house sign had gone up, only one of those condos remained.</p>
                            <p class="body">The latest Balmoral offerings push Bahamian-owned Aristo Development’s projects beyond  the $130 million mark.</p>
