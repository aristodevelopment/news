                            <p class="body">Night view of southern exposure, Paradise Island, the first new condo planned for Paradise Island in a decade. Aristo Development, which is partnering with Sterling Financial Group for the project, said this week that over one-third of the units have been sold prior to the official launch set for the second week in October.</p>
                            <p class="body">"Paradise  Island  is  home  to  many  of  the  world’s  top  business  executives,  elite  athletes,  and Hollywood  celebrities,  said  Matthew  Marco,  Director  of  Sales  and  Marketing  for  Aristo  Development, which  is  developing  the  project  in  partnership  with  Sterling  Financial  Group. Our  goal  in  designing THIRTY | SIX was to benefit from those features that have drawn so many successful people to Paradise Island  and  introduce  into  that  mix  an  accessible  residential  property  with  competitive  pricing  while maintaining the quality buyers have come to expect."</p>
                            <p class="body">The  project,  Paradise  Island,  is  a  three-storey  condominium  consisting  of 38  residences  on  Bay View  Drive.  With  clean  lines,  extensive  use  of  glass,  large  balconies  and  amenities  that  include  infinity pool,  fitness  centre,  security,  covered  parking  and  concierge  services,  it  is the  latest  in  a  series  of residential developments by Aristo Development and the first in which the developer is partnering with Sterling Financial Group.</p>
                            <p class="body">Sterling Chairman David Kosoy explained the appeal.</p>
                            <p class="body">"There is something magical about Paradise Island, said the man who could have chosen to live anywhere  and  selected  Paradise  Island  for  his  own  residence. ͞You  have  all  the  benefits  of  being  a minute’s  golf  cart  ride  away  from  a  resort –  golf  course,  dining  options  galore,  beaches,  tennis,  spas, luxury shopping, entertainment – yet you enjoy the privacy of your own home. Add year-round warmth, personal  service,  a  beautifully-designed,  well  thought  out  structure,  and  excellent  security  and  an offering like THIRTY | SIX has it all."</p>
                            <p class="body">The demand for right-sized, right-priced property on Paradise Island is so pressing, according to Aristo  Development  President  Jason  Kinsale,  that  the  long  search  for  the  land  and  the  preparations  to build were worth every minute of effort.</p>
                            <p class="body">"We’ve literally had to turn down offers because  all of the studio and one-bedroom residences have already been sold and we have not yet had the official launch which, at this moment, is set for the second  week  in  October,  said  Kinsale.  H.G.  Christie  Real  Estate,  which  has  been  named  the  exclusiveagency, will co-host the unveiling, an invitation-only event.</p>
                            <p class="body">The  building  is  a  mix  of  exquisitely  designed  studio,  one-bedroom  and  two-bedroom  units,  all with walls of storm-rated glass, ultra-modern kitchens and baths, world class quality finishes and broad-planked wood flooring. Prices range from $450,000 for a studio to just over $1 million for a penthouse with private rooftop terrace.</p>
                            <p class="body">THIRTY  |  SIX  Paradise  Island  is  Aristo’s  fourth  residential  project.  The  company’s  first  two, Hampton  Ridge  and  Balmoral,  are  sold  out  with  the  exception  of  three  rooftop  residences  just  nearing completion at Balmoral on Sandford Drive. Its third project, ONE Cable Beach, is also enjoying brisk sales and is on schedule, with site prep work and underground infrastructure complete and foundation works well underway.  With THIRTY | SIX now in the mix, Aristo’s current real estate developments are nearing the $140 million mark in value while Sterling Financial Group has developed in excess of $2 billion worth of real estate throughout the North American market.</p>
