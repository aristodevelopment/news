                            <p class="body">A multimillion project of luxury residences just steps away from Baha Mar confirmed today that it will continue full steam ahead despite news that the neighbouring $3.5 billion Baha Mar resort project filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection June 29.<br><br>"ONE Cable Beach will definitely move ahead as planned, Aristo Development President & CEO Jason Kinsale said. Like everyone else, we were caught off guard, shocked and saddened by the halting of the Baha Mar project, which we trust is temporary, but we immediately got on the phone, shared the news  with  those  clients  who  purchased  residences  pre-construction,  and  were  very  relieved  to  hear that, like us, their belief in The Bahamas and the future of this country remained firm."<br><br>According to Kinsale, none of the purchasers requested a refund.<br><br>"Quite the contrary, he said. Most saw it as a hiccup and looked at the broader picture.  Both local and international investors  felt they got in at the best available price in a location that is going to remain  highly  sought  after  because  it  is  one  of  the  last  pieces  of  oceanfront  on  the  northern  coast  of New  Providence.  Whether  you  call  it  the  Bahamian  Riviera  or  Cable  Beach,  the  reality  is  that  it  is  a spectacular piece of shoreline that is hard to match anywhere in the world– close to conveniences and far from boring."<br><br>The  $40  million  development,  located  almost  immediately  west  of  Melia,  will  be  seven  stories and is defined by its striking architecture that includes curving balconies that almost appear to float. It’s 
a  design  that  Kinsale,  who  also  developed  the  popular  community  of  Balmoral,  calls  dynamic  and inviting.<br><br>"There is almost an organic, free-floating feel, he said. Even looking at the design gives you an almost palpable sense of freedom, inspiration and pleasure."<br><br>With  nearly  70  residences  ranging  in  price  from  $555,000  for  a  one-bedroom  to  $3  million  for the  3,900  square  foot,  3-bedroom  penthouse  facing  the  sea,  ONE  Cable  Beach  features  ocean  and garden views, swimming  pool, fitness centre,  security, storm-rated windows and oversized doors, high ceilings, and quality construction with  the finest in finishing details. In late June, dozens turned out for an open house in late June and interest has been evenly divided between local and international clients, according to the developer.<br><br>Site   preparation   is   underway   and   construction   has   started   even   ahead   of   the   official groundbreaking  ceremony  that  is  expected  to  be  announced  shortly. Some  200  construction  jobs  are anticipated during the building of ONE Cable Beach that should be complete in less than two years.<br><br>"We  all  hope  that  Baha  Mar  will  soon  be  back  on  track, said  Kinsale. But  we  are  pleased  to share some good news that ONE Cable Beach will make many good jobs and opportunities available and provide a solid, serious boost to the Bahamian economy."</p>
